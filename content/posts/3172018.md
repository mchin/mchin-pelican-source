Yay! I'm so happy I finished my first freelance project: [bobbieg.com](http://bobbieg.com)
  
It took about a month to get everything done. The only major issue was changing the DNS records in Godaddy using Squarespace's A and CNAME records. Once the site was connected, we had to disconnect the site and reconnect the site for the SSL certificate to be recognized as ACTIVE.

I was introduced to BobbieG through Kelly. BobbieG needed a new website because her current one was from the early 2000s. I set her up on Squarespace, configured the Acuity Schedulder, and configured the DNS records to get the site up from Godaddy.
