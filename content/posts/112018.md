After struggling with Javascript, and *trying* to motivate myself...

I've decided to learn Python instead through a [CCSF Course](https://www.ccsf.edu/Schedule/CD/CS%20131A.htm) and I also decided to redo my portfolio site using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com), a Python backend static generator.

I installed the Pelican Quickstart on my local machine last night and it seemed to be working.

Today, I was trying to add a theme, but couldn't get it working.

I also kept getting an error when trying to launch the virtual server.

I had to install and re-install Pelican a few times to try and get things right.

Ultimately, I had to update my version of Python and that fixed my issues.

I finally got a theme loaded in!
